# Conway's Game of Life using Tkinter
This is a poorly implemented version of Conway's Game of Life.
Cells act very strangely when aproaching edges creating what I call
"edge cascades". Cases where growth rate becomes exponential on edges.
The GUI classes should 100% be seperated from the logical functions.
Due to Tkinter's performance, it will not be updated. Using pyGame
to reimplement this more correctly with better performance.
